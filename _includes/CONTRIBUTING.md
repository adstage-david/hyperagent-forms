Start the development server that transpiles the module as you modify them:

```bash
grunt server
```

Make sure to test your changes and run `grunt test` to run the suite in
PhantomJS, Chrome and Firefox. Your code should follow the fit the style of the
project, which is roughly based on
[Crockford's white space rules](http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html).

When done with your changes, push them to a feature branch, open a [pull
request](http://github.com/passy/hyperagent.js/issues/) and enjoy our infinite
